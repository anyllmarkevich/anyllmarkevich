## Hey there, fellow citizen of Github!
I am an aspiring ecologist and evolutionary biologist focusing on multi-scale interactions and the intersection of theory and empirical research. Lately, I've become fascinated by the processes linking complex behavioral traits with population-level evolution. Additional interests include inter-trophic interactions, impacts of animal behavior on vegetation structure, environmental influences on animal behavior, and adaptation to climate change.

In addition to these research interests, I'm passionate about education and science communication, and I am committed to advancing conservation, especially through community-based conservation. Ultimately, I hope to become a professor to advance research while supporting and empowering the next generation of scientists and changemakers.
## Current Activities
I am currently a part-time Education Data Analyst at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I collect and analyze data on student educational outcomes to improve teaching methodology.

I recently received a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies from Prescott College (which included a year of coursework at CU Boulder), and I am currently seeking graduate school opportunities.
### Programming Experience
I've used code to streamline data entry via a GUI during fieldwork, manage and clean up data during analysis, and create GIS maps, in addition to numerous experimental and hobby projects. I continue to use these skills in my current work!

These are the languages I've worked with: **R, Rust, Python, Swift, Bash, Java**, and spotty uses of HTML, SQL, etc.
### Background
You can read my [academic CV](https://github.com/anyllmarkevich/anyllmarkevich/blob/4222800e21241fa5f3e7a86be6bcd6ee7956d548/Anyll%20Markevich%20CV%20(Dec%202025).pdf) (not a resume) for details on my research experience and broader background.
### Other Skills and Stuff
- GIS (QGIS & System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses)
- Wildlife Photography
- 3D Graphics and Animation with Blender
- 2D Graphics and Drawing (more recently)
